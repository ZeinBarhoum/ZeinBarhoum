## About Me

I'm a Mechatronics and Robotics Engineer with a Master's degree in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. With a strong passion for cutting-edge technology, I strive to develop innovative solutions in the field of robotics.

## Skills

- Programming Languages: Python, C, C++, MATLAB
- Robotics: ROS/ROS2 (Robot Operating System)
- AI: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- Computer Vision: OpenCV
- CAD and Simulation: SolidWorks, Inventor, Ansys
- Simulators: IsaacSim, Gazebo, Pybullet, MuJoCo

## Projects

### Underwater Glider

- Description: The Underwater Glider is an autonomous underwater vehicle that operates without external propellers or thrusters. Its motion is achieved through control of the buoyancy-gravity force balance and the center of gravity. This project involved the design, modeling, simulation, manufacturing, testing, and control of the underwater glider.
- Technologies Used: SolidWorks, Ansys, MATLAB, Simulink, C
- Repository: [Underwater-Glider](https://github.com/ZeinBarhoum/Underwater-Glider)

### Chess Manipulator

- Description: Chess Manipulator is a simulation of a FRANKA EMIKA Panda robotic arm programmed to play chess. The project utilizes Gazebo simulation and ROS2 for implementation. The robotic arm is capable of making chess moves and interacting with the chessboard in a simulated environment.
- Technologies Used: ROS2, Python, Gazebo, ros2_control
- Repository: [chess_manipulator](https://github.com/ZeinBarhoum/chess_manipulator)

### Reinforcement Learning For Quadrotors

- Description: The Quadrotor Reinforcement Learning project focuses on teaching a quadrotor how to fly in a simulated environment using reinforcement learning algorithms. The project utilizes PyTorch and Stable Baselines3 for implementing the reinforcement learning algorithms, and the simulated environment is created using PyBullet and Gymnasium.
- Technologies Used: PyTorch, Stable Baselines3, PyBullet, Gymnasium
- Repository: [RL-quadrotor](https://github.com/ZeinBarhoum/RL-quadrotor)

### Quadrotor Stack

- Description: A Ros2-based modular system for to facilitate research and development of quadrotor simulation, trajectory planning, path optimization and motion tracking. There are multiple packages done in this project, each representing a module in the quadrotor navigation system, this includes simulation, path planning, trajectory generation, trajectory tracking and vision-based mapping. The modules interact with each other using ROS2 topics in a non-synchronous way, each module in the system can run in a unique rate which simulates the real-life case.
- Technologies Used: ROS2, PyTorch, PyBullet, AirSim
- Repository: [Quadrotor Stack](https://github.com/ZeinBarhoum/quadrotor-stack)
