## About Me

I'm a Mechatronics and Robotics Engineer currently pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. With a strong passion for cutting-edge technology, I strive to develop innovative solutions in the field of robotics.

## Skills

- Programming Languages: Python, C, C++, MATLAB
- Robotics: ROS/ROS2 (Robot Operating System)
- AI: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- Computer Vision: OpenCV
- CAD and Simulation: SolidWorks, Inventor, Ansys
- Simulators: Gazebo, Pybullet

## Projects

### Underwater Glider

- Description: The Underwater Glider is an autonomous underwater vehicle that operates without external propellers or thrusters. Its motion is achieved through control of the buoyancy-gravity force balance and the center of gravity. This project involved the design, modeling, simulation, manufacturing, testing, and control of the underwater glider.
- Technologies Used: SolidWorks, Ansys, MATLAB, Simulink, C
- Repository: [Underwater-Glider](https://github.com/ZeinBarhoum/Underwater-Glider)

### Chess Manipulator

- Description: Chess Manipulator is a simulation of a FRANKA EMIKA Panda robotic arm programmed to play chess. The project utilizes Gazebo simulation and ROS2 for implementation. The robotic arm is capable of making chess moves and interacting with the chessboard in a simulated environment.
- Technologies Used: ROS2, Python, Gazebo, ros2_control
- Repository: [chess_manipulator](https://github.com/ZeinBarhoum/chess_manipulator)

### Reinforcement Learning For Quadrotors

- Description: The Quadrotor Reinforcement Learning project focuses on teaching a quadrotor how to fly in a simulated environment using reinforcement learning algorithms. The project utilizes PyTorch and Stable Baselines3 for implementing the reinforcement learning algorithms, and the simulated environment is created using PyBullet and Gymnasium.
- Technologies Used: PyTorch, Stable Baselines3, PyBullet, Gymnasium
- Repository: [RL-quadrotor](https://github.com/ZeinBarhoum/RL-quadrotor)
